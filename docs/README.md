  <h3 align="center">The ARTI Framework</h3>
  <p align="center">
    A framework designed to simulate the signals produced by the secondary particles emerging from the interaction of the flux of primary cosmic ray with the atmosphere. These signals are simulated for any particle detector located at any place (latitude, longitude and altitude), including the real-time atmospheric, geomagnetic and detector conditions.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ARTI Documentation

The ARTI Documentation is currently being under development. It will be released on  the 2nd semester of 2022. In the meantime, all the ARTI codes and scripts have their own built-in help that can be accessed by run the command using the `-?` modifier.

Please stay tuned for further information and don't hesitate to [contact us](#contact).
