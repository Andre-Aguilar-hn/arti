The bash scrip maketable-forRun-magcos.sh sets the parameters for
run MAGNETOCOSMICS: Tsyganenkov (G1 and G2), DST. Pdyn, and
geomagnetic components magnitude (By and Bz) according with
time/date. All these parameter are reading from wghour.d
(decompress before use it).

How to run:

Search in wghour.d the line(s) of time wanted to simulate, for
instances, if the date wanted to simulate is March 23th, 2014 at
01:00 hours, so the line inside wghour.d containing this date is 441085.

Iterate over different dates is possible.
